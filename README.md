# 12.web-scraping-challenge

In this assignment we are asked to utilize the skills we have learned so far and create a website that contains scraped information from different sites.

How the homework was executed was first writting out the code in jupyter lab to scrape the information and pulling the information needed that we would illustrate on our site. After doing this, the code was replicated, but this time in python file which would be referenced by an app.py flask application.

The flask application was utilized to create our mongo collection and would allow us to redirect us to our scraping python script and then running the home page.

The last part of this homework was updating and editing our HTML so it could illustrate the query from our flask application.
